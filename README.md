# Trading-Strategy-Optimizer
This repository contains a strategy-agnostic framework designed for the rigorous development, backtesting, and optimization of algorithmic trading strategies. The system prioritizes statistical robustness over curve fitting by enforcing strict In-Sample (IS) and Out-of-Sample (OOS) separation, degradation analysis, and regime performance metrics.
